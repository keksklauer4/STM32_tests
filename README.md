Hi, these are some tests for my stm32f1 written in Cortex M3 assembly.

Note that
1. I did not fully test all functionality,
2. the hashtable does not allow for deletion (was not my goal),
3. I took the linker script from another github project (I will link this at some point in the future),
4. you honestly should not use this in a practical application since I only tested in qemu (see https://github.com/beckus/qemu_stm32) and due to limited functionality.

I am not responsible for anything you do with this code. Feel free to change whatever you want.
